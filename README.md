# *Welcome to the Your-Goals app*
an app allow you to set goals and track them

**Architecture** 

The App is architected using MVC. 
The Framework I used is UIKit.

**Improvements to be handled**

* Add accessibility 
* Handle Light/Dark Mode
* Jira tickets or github issues in my commits. It's usually in format XXX-Description with branch for every story. 

**Features would have like to add:**

* Add edit button - to be able to edit an existing goal and the progress.
